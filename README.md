# konnspy
A port of [tcpspy](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Tcpspyy), written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org), updated to also support IPv6.

## What is tcpspy?

From [tcpspy's homepage](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Tcpspyy):
> tcpspy is an administrator's tool that logs information about incoming and outgoing TCP/IP connections including local address, remote address, and the username of the user responsible for the connection. Connections are selected for logging with rules, similar to the filter expressions accepted by tcpdump and other libpcap-based applications (tcpspy does not, however, use libpcap).

## Kotlin?

Yes. Please read [Why Kotlin is my next programming language.](https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3)

## Credits

Kudos goes to Tim J. Robbins for writing the initial `tcpspy` tool
